# slog-rs - The Logging for [Rust][rust]

### Introduction

`slog` is an ecosystem of reusable components for structured, extensible,
composable logging for [Rust][rust].

The ambition is to be The Logging Framework for Rust. `slog` should accommodate a
variety of logging features and requirements.

### Status & news

`slog v2` (versions `2.x.y`) is the latest stable major release. API of `slog
v2` is very similar to `slog v1` and most changes are under the hood, unleashing
more power. Porting should be relatively easy.

See [`slog v2` wiki page](https://github.com/slog-rs/slog/wiki/slog-v2)
for more information.

Note: at the time of writing, many important `slog` ecosystem crates might
still not have a stable release for `slog v2` and you might need to point
to their pre-release versions. Eg. (`Cargo.toml` excerpt):

```
slog-term = "~2.0.0-4"
```

`slog v1` (versions `1.x.y`) is a previous stable major release. No new development
is planned, but bugfixes and PRs are always welcome.

### Features & technical documentation

Most of the interesting documentation is using rustdoc itself.

You can view it at [docs.rs/slog for v1](https://docs.rs/slog/1/) or [docs.rs/slog
for v2](https://docs.rs/slog/2/).

### Terminal output example

`slog-term` is only one of many `slog` features - useful showcase,
featuring eg. automatic TTY detection and colors.

See following screenshot: same output in both compact and full output mode.

## Using & help

See
[examples/slog1/features.rs](https://github.com/slog-rs/misc/blob/master/examples/slog1/features.rs)
for full quick code example overview.

See [faq] for answers to common questions and [wiki] for other documentation
articles. If you want to say hi, or need help use [slog-rs gitter] channel.

Read [Documentation](https://docs.rs/slog/) for details and features.

#### In your project

In Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
slog = "2"
```

In your `main.rs`:

```
#[macro_use]
extern crate slog;
```

## Slog community

Slog related crates are hosted under [slog github
organization](https://github.com/slog-rs).

Dawid Ciężarkiewicz is the original author and current maintainer of `slog` and
therefore self-appointed benevolent dictator over the project. When working on
slog Dawid follows and expects everyone to follow his [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/dpc/public/blob/master/COC.md).

Any particular repositories under slog ecosystem might be created, controlled,
maintained by other entities with various levels of autonomy. Lets work together
toward a common goal in a respectful and welcoming atmosphere!
